--[[
	State persistence for openuf.

	Reads and writes /etc/openuf/state.json (configurable via M._state_file,
	which the entry points set from conf.lua's config.state_file).

	Typed fields, each with a default that a wrong-typed value on disk falls
	back to: authkey (32-char hex), adopted (bool), cfgversion (string),
	inform_url (string), use_gcm (bool), upgrade_requested_version (string),
	upgrade_requested_url (string), blocked_stas (array of MAC strings).

	Everything else save() was handed comes back from load() as-is. That is
	not an accident of cjson.encode -- it is load-bearing: inform.lua keeps
	the switch reversibility ledger (swvlan_backup), the IP Settings mode
	(ip_mode, static_*), the last identity MAC (mac), the Locate and LED
	state here too, and USAGE.md documents them as persisted. load() used to
	read back only the typed fields above, so all of those were written on
	every save and silently discarded on every start: the identity-change
	warning never had a previous MAC to compare against, and a daemon
	restart made the switch ledger re-snapshot already-mutated sections as
	the board's originals.

	Security invariant: if adopted == false, authkey is always reset to the
	default key on load, regardless of what the file contains. This prevents a
	stale key from blocking adoption after a reset.
